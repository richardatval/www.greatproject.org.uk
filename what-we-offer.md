#### The GREAT Project is here to help individuals within families move toward employment and training. 

Rather than provide a one-size-fits-all solution, we’ll work with you to understand the challenges that you face. Together, we will then design a support package that’s right for you.

### Who we help

We can help you if you are: 

* Over 18 and not currently in paid work
* Willing to participate
* Living in Leicester or Leicestershire
* Eligible to work legally in the UK
* Part of a family as one of the following:
	* A parent with children living at home, or;
    * A parent who has contact with their children of school age or below, or;
    * An adult living with parents or other family members
    
And if you experience at least one of the following barriers to employment or training:

* Lack of confidence or motivation
* Lack of skills, experience or qualifications
* Disabilities and health conditions
* Mental health or anxiety
* Lack of job skills
* Language barriers
* Lack of access to childcare
* Worried about the effect on your benefits if you start work
* Lack of opportunities 
* Time pressures at home
* Other family members
* Transport or cost of transport

If this sounds like you, get in touch and see if the GREAT Project can support you.

### Support you can access

When you get involved with the GREAT Project, you’ll be able to access support from our partners. This support includes: 

* Health assessments, diagnosis support and occupational health support, to help you overcome any health-related barriers to work and training
* Support with key employment skills, like CV writing and interviewing
* Taster days and work experience in a range of industries 
* Help with managing your money, including accounts that accommodate Sharia law
* Focused support for communities with particular needs, such as the Eastern European population
* Work clubs in libraries to offer one-to-one support with job searching
* Confidence building courses
* Childcare support, so you can attend the courses that best fit your needs
* Vocational training courses offering qualifications. These include female-only courses where needed

Each individual is different, so throughout the process of building your support package, you’ll receive one-to-one support from a support worker. Together, you’ll build a plan which takes your individual needs, goals and challenges into account.
