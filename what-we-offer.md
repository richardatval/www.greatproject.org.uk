#### The GREAT Project is here to help individuals within families move toward employment and training. 

Rather than provide a one size fits all solution, we’ll work with you to understand the challenges you face. Together, we will then design a support package that’s right for you. 

### Support you can access

When you get involved with the GREAT Project, you’ll be able to access support from our partners. This support includes: 

* Health assessments, diagnosis support and occupational health support to help you overcome any health-related barriers to work and training
* Support with key employment skills, like CV writing and interviewing
* Taster days and work experience in a range of industries 
* Help with managing your money, including accounts that accommodate Sharia law
* Focused support for communities with particular needs, such as the Eastern European population
* Work clubs in libraries to offer one-to-one support with job searching
* Confidence building courses
* Childcare support so you can attend the courses that best fit your needs
* Vocational training courses offering qualifications. These include female only courses where needed

Each individual is different, so throughout the process of building your support package, you’ll receive one-to-one support from a support worker. Together, you’ll build a plan which takes your individual needs, goals and challenges into account. 

### Who we help

We want to hear about the challenges you face if you: 

* are not working
* are a member of a family
* live in Leicester or Leicestershire
* not currently in training
* are aged 18 or older
