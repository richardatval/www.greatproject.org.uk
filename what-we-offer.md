#### The GREAT Project is here to help individuals within families move toward employment and training. 

Rather than provide a one-size-fits-all solution, we’ll work with you to understand the challenges that you face. Together, we will then design a support package that’s right for you.

Each individual is different, so throughout the process of building your support package, you’ll receive one-to-one support from an Employment Support Officer (ESO). Together, you’ll build a plan which takes your individual needs, goals and challenges into account. 

### Support you can access

When you get involved with the GREAT Project, you’ll be able to access support from our partners and from our Employment Coordinators, who deliver training courses around employability skills. Each partner offers something different that you might like to get involved in, and your ESO will be able to help you decide which partners you might want to work with.
