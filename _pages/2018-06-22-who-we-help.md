The GREAT Project was created to help members of families in Leicester and Leicestershire. When we decide who is eligible to receive our support, we have a specific definition of what we mean by 'member of a family'.

### What we mean by 'family'

We can help you if you are one of the following:

* A parent with children living at home, or;
* A parent who has contact with their children of school age or below, or;
* An adult living with parents or other family members

### Other requirements

As well as being a member of a family, you must also be:

* Over 18 and not currently in paid work
* Willing to participate in the project's activities
* Living in Leicester or Leicestershire
* Eligible to work legally in the UK

### Barriers to work
    
For us to offer you support, you must also experience at least one of the following barriers to employment or training:

* Lack of confidence or motivation
* Lack of skills, experience or qualifications
* Disabilities and health conditions
* Mental health or anxiety
* Lack of job skills
* Language barriers
* Lack of access to childcare
* Worried about the effect on your benefits if you start work
* Lack of opportunities 
* Time pressures at home
* Other family members
* Transport or cost of transport
