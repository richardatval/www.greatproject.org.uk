#### The GREAT Project is here to help families who are not currently in employment or training, move toward work. ‘GREAT’ stands for ‘Getting Ready for Employment and Training’. 

The service is run by a range of statutory, not-for-profit and private companies. This partnership approach means that we can offer a holistic, person-centred service which is tailored to each family's unique needs. 

The GREAT Project is delivered by Voluntary Action LeicesterShire and funded by the Big Lottery Fund and the European Social Fund.
