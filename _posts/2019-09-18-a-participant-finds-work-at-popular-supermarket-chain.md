Before joining the GREAT Project, Peter was unemployed and living at home with his mum and sister. He was introduced to the GREAT Project by a Family Support Worker from Supporting Leicestershire Families, and after hearing about all the project has to offer, he decided it could be the project to support him. 

When Peter met with his Employment Support Officer, Leah, he discussed his barriers and told her that he wanted to improve his confidence and employment skills. Leah recommended Peter attend in-house Employment Coordinator, Kenton’s, workshops on interview skills, confidence building and managing returning to work. These sessions gave Peter the essential knowledge he needed to feel more confident and improve his employability skills. Peter was initially anxious about participating in groups, but he soon learnt that the other participants were feeling the same and could relate to him. Overall, working in groups gave Peter the confidence he needed to move forward. 

Peter also attended Work Club whilst he was on the project. Here, he was able to work on his CV and cover letter, as well as learn which websites are best when looking for a job. 

Peter also worked with the in-house Vocational Rehabilitation Case Officer, and attended the strengths and motivations workshop. Here he was encouraged to write about his strengths and how he could transfer them to his everyday life. 

Peter met with delivery partner, Business in the Community, and they organised for him to attend an interview at a nationwide supermarket for a role within their warehouse. Peter was successfully offered the role and continues to work for the supermarket. 

Speaking of his time on the project, Peter said:

> “The GREAT Project gave me insight into how people see me, which made me see how good I really am. Everyone was really nice and had my best interests at heart. On top of that, they had a workshop for literally everything.”

Leah, Peter’s Employment Support Officer, said: 

> “I’m really proud of Peter for how far he’s come. I’m glad he was able to learn new skills and meet like-minded people that helped put him at ease. I’m happy he was able to benefit from the project and I wish him all the best for his new job.”
