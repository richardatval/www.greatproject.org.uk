In the last few months the GREAT Project has gone from strength to strength. The number of people engaged by the project has passed 250 people, with more than 70 successfully moving on to work, training or formal job searching. However, with more than three quarters of GREAT participants being women, the project is looking to recruit more men. That’s why they are launching their ‘GREAT men get things done’ campaign.

Ivan Liburd is the GREAT Project’s Delivery Coordinator and is leading on the campaign to increase the number of men on the project. He said:

> “We know there are lots of reasons that men don’t access support. Sometimes it’s about not admitting there’s a problem, or just not feeling comfortable talking about health issues. Many men can also be suspicious that they’ll spend months attending sessions and still have nothing to show for it at the end.

> We want men in Leicester and Leicestershire to know that the GREAT Project is different to other services they might have accessed. Our participants leave the project with something practical, whether that’s some new training, job search skills or a job.”

One of the men we've helped on the project is Rickin - find out more about [his experience with GREAT](https://www.greatproject.org.uk/2018/10/02/overcoming-health-barriers-to-get-back-into-work/).

It’s really easy to get involved with the GREAT Project. If you're an individual who needs support, you can contact us directly on 0116 257 5020 or through our [contact form]. We can tell you over the phone whether or not you're eligible for support from GREAT. (https://www.greatproject.org.uk/contact/).

If you’re an organisation that works with men who would benefit from the GREAT Project’s support, contact Ivan at ivan.l@greatproject.org.uk.
