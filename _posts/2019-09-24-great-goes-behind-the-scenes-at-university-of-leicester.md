On 9 September 2019, the GREAT Project visited the University of Leicester for a behind the scenes tour. The university welcomed the GREAT Project, along with some participants, to their campus to talk to us about the variety of roles they have available and how individuals can access higher education courses.  
We started the day with an introduction to the university where we learnt a range of interesting facts – its home to approximately 20,000 students and 4,000 staff! The university employs individuals for an array of different roles, and we were given some example job titles so we could see just how wide the variety of roles span. 

We discussed their recruitment process, including equality, diversity and inclusion, as well as how to apply for a role at the university. This was extremely beneficial for our participants as they got to hear first-hand how the university recruits. Next on the agenda, our participants pretended they were a hiring manager, shortlisting applications. This gave our participants an insight into what hiring managers look for on a CV, and how they compare CV’s and application forms to the job specification when gaging who would be suitable to interview. 

We then heard about higher education and how our participants could access university courses if it was of interest to them. We ended the day with a tour of the campus, which was extremely interesting! Take a look at some pictures to see what’s around on site! 

Thank you for having us, University of Leicester. It was a pleasure!
