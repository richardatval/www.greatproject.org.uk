This summer the GREAT Project will be appearing at events across Leicester and Leicestershire to promote our work to people from local communities.

We’ve already been to the Western Park Family Festival and the On the Green Fund Day at Leicester Caribbean Cricket Club, where we had a chance to talk to members of the public about the project, and made some connections which will hopefully bring some more referrals into the project in the future.

Over the coming months we will be appearing at:

- 28 July – Braunstone Town Summer Fete
- 4 August – Leicester Caribbean Carnival
- 19 August – Leicester Mela
- 19 August – Loughborough Mela

We will also be appearing at other events and will update you when we’ve confirmed where we’ll be.
Our stalls will have activities for kids, and we’ll have members of the GREAT team on hand to talk about the project and how people can get involved with us.

Come along and see us!
