Jessica had not long moved back to Leicester when she found out about the GREAT Project. She was attending the Leicester Town Hall’s summer Playday and came across a GREAT Project stall where she spoke with a member of the team. After discussing all the project can offer and what support it provides, Jessica felt like it was the right project for her. 

When Jessica spoke to the team, she felt lost and had little confidence or motivation to find a job. She’d spent a number of years self-employed and this affected her confidence; she didn’t know how to get out there and look for a job anymore. 

> “When I joined the GREAT Project I was desperate for help. I really felt down about being unemployed but I just didn’t know what I could do to change it.”

Jessica met with Harinder, her Employment Support Officer (ESO), to discuss her options and what she wanted to achieve whilst on the project. The main support Jessica wanted was help around applying for jobs, including writing her CV. However, once Harinder explained all the opportunities that were available, Jessica was quick to take up the range of support available to her.  

Not only did she receive the support she wanted when it came to applying for jobs, she also attended in-house workshops based on interview techniques and self-employment. What really helped Jessica though, and what she credits her new found confidence to, is her participation on the three day confidence building course. This course is designed to encourage participants to work with one another in order to solve problems and complete tasks. With this new confidence, Jessica visited BBC Leicester Radio to speak on air about her time with the project.  

Jessica also completed a work placement organised by delivery partner, Business in the Community. She enjoyed her time so much with the homelessness charity, she applied for a paid position within the organisation. The charity was so impressed by Jessica, they offered her the role.  

Jessica said:

> “Meeting with Harinder gave me a purpose and the belief that I was going to be okay. Attending the workshops gave me the chance to meet other people in a similar position to myself, and that helped me a lot. The project heard and understood me, and that meant the most.”

Harinder said: 

> “I’m thrilled Jessica has come so far and achieved the goal she set out to do. She came to us unsure she would ever be able to find work and now she’s employed and enjoying it. Her progress over the months has been incredible and I really am exceptionally proud of all she’s achieved.”

Jessica continues to work for the homelessness charity and is enjoying her new role.
