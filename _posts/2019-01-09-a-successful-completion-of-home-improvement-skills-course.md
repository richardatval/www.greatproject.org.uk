Enstruct is one of the GREAT Projects delivery partners and focuses on delivering key construction and home improvement skills to participants. Over the course of 10 weeks, participants have the opportunity to learn a variety of skills including tiling, plumbing, bricklaying, electrics and carpentry. In some cases, participants can also undergo training to obtain a CSCS qualification. 

Bradley, a participant from The GREAT Project, has recently completed the 10-week course at Enstruct and earned a certificate acknowledging his achievement. Bradley is not only taking away an abundance of skills he didn’t have before, but also a comic book themed storage box he built especially for his son. 

Bradley said: 

> I really enjoyed my time at Enstruct, and I learnt so many core skills whilst I was there. Having now completed the course, I feel so much more confident in my capabilities and I’m excited to look for work in the construction field. 

> I’m due to enrol on another construction course next year, and I’m really excited about starting it. If it wasn’t for The GREAT Project suggesting I go to Enstruct, I wouldn’t have had the confidence to do this.

Enstruct is a family-run business based in Leicester, offering training in both environmental and constructional fields. With a dedicated and skilled team, they provide a comfortable environment for participants to develop their skills.
