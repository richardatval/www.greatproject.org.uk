Before joining the GREAT Project, Daniel* was unemployed and living at home with his parents. He’d been out of work for ten months and was at a loss with what to do next. At his local Jobcentre, he came into contact with the GREAT Project, and felt it was the project best suited to support him.

Daniel expressed to his Employment Support Officer, Leah, that he wanted to gain experience and learn new skills. This was taken into consideration by Leah when designing his bespoke programme of activities. 

Leah began by helping Daniel with his CV; she showed him best practices and what not to write. The next thing for Daniel was attending an interview skills workshop. Here, participants are shown different interview scenarios, techniques on answering interview questions and how to handle themselves in a professional setting. Daniel benefitted from this and attended pre-placement training, delivered by Business in the Community, to hone in on his new skills. Here, participants are taught a variety of topics such as; what to expect in a work place, best practices and making a good first impression.  

Daniel then felt ready to undertake a two-week work placement at a British multinational retailer. He enjoyed his experience so much, that when the retailer offered him a more permanent position, he was happy to accept. 

Speaking of his time on the project, Daniel said: 

> “The GREAT Project really helped me increase my confidence and encouraged me to come out of my comfort zone. I got to speak to new people, learnt new skills and I also learnt how to feel better about travelling alone. Most importantly though, I got the chance to work in a retail environment.”

Leah said:

> “I’m really happy with the progress Daniel has made. He’s come a long way and managed to do the things he set out to do when he joined the project. I’m happy I could help him and hope he’s happy in his new role.”

Daniel is currently enjoying his time at the retailer and is looking forward to what the future holds.
