title: How We Are Helping
summary: >-
  The GREAT Project is already working with participants to provide unique
  support in helping them to move towards work or training. Here are some
  examples.

One of the key elements of the GREAT Project’s approach is recognising the individual and often unique needs of those within families who want to move towards work or training. 
 
Even when the support required may seem to be something shared by other participants, the circumstances, and therefore the help required, are often very different. Without this acknowledgement, we would arrive at an unhelpful “one size fits all” approach.  

Working with those who have referred themselves or been referred to the project, we’ve already had the benefit of the individual approach reinforced. 

Here are a couple of recent examples of the kind of support we can provide: 

_A woman who moved to the UK some years ago, with young children is a graduate but never worked in this country. Her confidence is low, not knowing how a typical interview would go, or how to dress for it. We were able to supply support in applying for Jobseekers’ Allowance, accompanying her to the first meeting and suggesting techniques to conquer nerves in pursuing her contact with them, as this lack of confidence was holding her back._

Every family has unique needs, so we provide unique support. 
 
_In another instance, we have worked with a male with learning disabilities. He would to like to learn a trade and will be accessing our construction taster course. He has also had travel training with his Enablement Officer. On first visit, he was not very responsive due to medical issues. The meeting was rescheduled, to allow time for these issues to be addressed. This second visit concluded with the completion of all the project paperwork and the young man fully engaged with the project._

In both of these cases, it would be easy to focus on the end goal alone and miss out on these necessary areas of support for the individual people concerned. 

We will be continuing to focus our support on the needs and goals of each of our participants throughout the project.
