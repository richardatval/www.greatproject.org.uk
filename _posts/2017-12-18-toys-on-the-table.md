title: Toys on the Table

The GREAT Project is proud to have been collecting toys for Toys on the Table. It will mean so much to so many families. Thank you to everyone who donated.

Toys on the Table is a Charity working in the Leicester and Leicestershire area, which provides NEW toys and gifts at the holiday season for those children, regardless of faith, who might otherwise not receive anything.
