The GREAT Project is holding an event on Tuesday, October 24th to celebrate and share its work so far and to offer its support to new participants moving forward. 

GREAT stands for Getting Ready for Work and Training. The project provides individualised support to individuals within families in Leicester and Leicestershire who want to move towards work or training but face barriers to doing so. 

Every participant is different and the GREAT Project works with specialised delivery partners to ensure that the support offered is tailored to them. Employment Navigators for the project work personally with the participants to identify their barriers and build a support package right for them. 

Getting to Know the GREAT Project is being held to allow the GREAT Project team, Employment Navigators, participants and organisations whose own service users could benefit from the support available to meet, share their work and discover ways in which they can work together. 

It takes place on October 24th, 2017 at [Big Shed Conferencing](Big Shed Conferencing), 93 Commercial Square, Freemens Common, Leicester LE2 7SR.  

The event will begin at 10:30 am with tea and coffee, followed by presentations at 11 am. Admission is free and lunch will be provided. 

Spaces are limited, so early booking is recommended.
