The GREAT Project has been supporting individuals into work or training for the last two years, and as it enters into its third year, the project has signed up and supported over 400 participants. However, the project still needs to engage with more participants to reach its lifetime target of 500 sign-ups. The GREAT Project is keen to sign up more participants, especially men, and encourage those that have barriers to work and need support to contact them.

The GREAT Project helps participants overcome different barriers and provides ongoing support, and to date, the project has helped over 70 people get back into paid employment, with a further 39 moving into further education or training.

Vandna Gohil, Executive Manager of the GREAT Project, said:

> “We want to reach out to men who could benefit, as we understand there’s varying reasons why men don’t always access support that’s available. But with the GREAT Project, we offer something totally different to the support they may have accessed before.”

The project takes both self-referrals and organisational referrals, and encourages those that have barriers to work and need support to contact them. Individuals can self-refer by texting GREAT and their name to 66777 or by calling 0116 257 5020.
