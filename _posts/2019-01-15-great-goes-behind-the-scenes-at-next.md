On 12 December 2018, the GREAT Project and some of its participants spent the day at Next’s Leicestershire-based head office. Next is a multinational retail store supplying the latest trends in clothing, footwear and home décor.  

The GREAT team and some of its participants were invited along to spend the day with Next to see how their organisation works. We started the day with an insightful presentation on how Next functions, followed by some fun activities that let us see what Next looks for when recruiting potential employees. We ended the day with a tour around the entire Next campus, and we were all amazed at its size! There’s over 3,000 members of staff at Next’s Head Office, all working in a broad range of industries like finance, marketing, IT and design. 

The aim of visiting Next was to help our participants make informed choices about the different departments they could aspire to work in. We believe this is a crucial step in their journey, and are looking forward to our next behind the scenes tour!
