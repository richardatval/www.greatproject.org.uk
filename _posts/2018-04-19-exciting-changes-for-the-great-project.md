There have been a lot of exciting changes at the GREAT Project recently. We’ve just finished a round of recruitment to the project and we have some new staff members and roles to introduce.

## Employment Support Officers

Our Employment Navigators are now called Employment Support Officers (ESO). We’ve recruited six new ESOs, three of whom have already started work at the GREAT Project – welcome to Yachna, Suzi and Anita. More ESOs will be starting over the next month or so, and we’ll provide more updates.

## Employment Coordinators

As well as recruiting new ESOs, we’ve also created two new Employment Coordinator roles. The Employment Coordinators will work with the ESOs. We’ve already recruited one Coordinator – welcome to Kenton (who was previously GREAT’s Communications Officer) – and the other Coordinator will be joining us in the next few weeks.

## Encouraging more male participants

We’ve identified that we are seeing lower numbers of male participants on the GREAT Project than female. Ivan has joined us from Healthwatch Leicestershire as our new Delivery Coordinator to look at ways to improve the numbers of male participants.
