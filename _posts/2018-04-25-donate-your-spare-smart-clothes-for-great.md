title: Donate your spare smart clothes for GREAT
summary: >-
  Not all of our participants can afford to buy brand new clothes, so we're
  collecting formal clothes that we can give to interviewees ahead of their
  interviews.
---
One of the ways GREAT is helping our project participants to get ready for work is by preparing them for the interview process.

Successful interviews depend on knowing how to present yourself to prospective employers, and a part of that is making sure that interviewees are dressed appropriately. 

However, not all of our participants can afford to buy brand new clothes, so we're collecting formal clothes that we can give to interviewees ahead of their interviews.

### What we're looking for

We're looking for people to donate the following, for men and women, in all sizes:

- Complete smart suits
- Smart trousers
- Smart jackets
- Shirts and blouses

Any donated clothes which aren't used by the GREAT participants will be passed on to local charities.

If you'd like to donate something, please contact Suzi Hailes, GREAT Employment Support Officer:

suzi.h@greatproject.org.uk
