title: Taking an individual approach to helping families
---
![Construction]({{site.baseurl}}/img/GREATConstruction-fullsize-web.jpg)

The GREAT Project is a new programme designed to help individuals within families in Leicester and Leicestershire, who are not currently in employment or training, move toward work. ‘GREAT’ stands for ‘Getting Ready for Employment and Training’.

The service is run by a range of not-for-profit, statutory and private organisations, a partnership approach that allows the project to tailor support to each family’s unique needs.

This holistic, individualised approach is at the heart of the GREAT Project’s aims and covers a wide variety of potential barriers to work, including employment skills, money management, health, bespoke support for communities with particular needs, confidence-building and childcare. 

Heather Roythorne-Finch, Project Manager, outlined the project’s ethos: 

> “There are many families actively looking to move towards employment and training, all of whom face an individual set of challenges in doing so. A cookie-cutter, “one-size-fits-all” simply isn’t appropriate or effective, and often leads to frustration and disappointment on both sides. The GREAT Project will work with families to create a plan that takes into account and addresses their unique circumstances, giving them the tools to build their confidence and skills and improve their knowledge of and chances within the job market.”

Families in search of support can refer themselves to the programme, or be referred by organisations who work with them in other areas and feel they can benefit from the support on offer. 

Potential family participants are most likely to have children of school age living with them. They will be resident in Leicester or Leicestershire, not currently in work and have multiple barriers to employment or training.

Referrals will be taken on case-by-case basis, in discussion with the participant, to ensure the Project meets their employment and training goals.
