On 13 September 2019, the GREAT Project was lucky enough to take some participants over to Next’s Leicestershire-based head office. Next is a multinational retail store supplying the latest trends in clothing, footwear and home décor.

We started the day with an interactive introduction to all of Next’s operational departments; providing us with loads of interesting information about the organisation. We then were given a tour of the entire campus and got to see the various departments the campus hosts, including an entire mock shop! When we came back, we broke up into groups to complete a fun team building exercise that outlined the qualities Next looks for when recruiting employees. After this, participants were given top tips and tricks to incorporate into their CV and application forms in the future, as well as the opportunity to ask any questions they had. 

The aim of visiting Next was to help our participants make informed choices about the different departments they could look to work in. They also got insightful knowledge about the types of people next look to recruit, helping them in their future endeavours. We believe this is a crucial step in their journey, and are looking forward to our next behind the scenes tour!
