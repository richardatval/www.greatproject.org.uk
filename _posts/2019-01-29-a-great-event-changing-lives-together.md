Stories are a great way to tell people about what our project does and how we are benefiting local families. Therefore, we are holding our annual celebration event, Changing Lives Together, on Friday 1 March 2019. The event is to celebrate the achievements of remarkable people who have made efforts to overcome personal barriers, all to improve theirs and their family’s lives. 

Nominated by our Employment Support Officers, the winners are from all walks of life, across Leicester and Leicestershire and of all ages. Their achievements are an inspiring lesson for us all in remembering that we can all overcome the challenges that life throws at us.

The event brings together local stakeholders from private sector business, public sector, local authority and the voluntary sector to demonstrate the contribution that stakeholders and businesses have collectively made, with the GREAT project, towards changing and improving the lives of participants. In essence, the event will bring to life, how the project has allowed us to do GREAT things, with GREAT people, for GREAT people. 

Vandna Gohil, Executive Manager for the GREAT Project, said:

> Many of the participants we support suffer from anxiety and low self-esteem, especially when it comes to finding employment. For us, helping them through their journey to gain new skills, improve their confidence and overcome their barriers is the most rewarding feeling. Many of our participants do go on to find paid employment, and this event is a great way for us to celebrate their efforts. 

> One of the things we also want to do is to encourage more referrals from organisations, particularly those working with men. So this event provides us with an opportunity to tell others about all the beneficial work the GREAT Project is doing.
