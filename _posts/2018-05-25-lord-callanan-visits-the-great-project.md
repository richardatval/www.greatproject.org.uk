In April the GREAT Project was excited to host Lord Callanan, Minister of State at the Department for Exiting the European Union. Lord Callanan visited us to find out more about the impact that projects like GREAT can have, and the challenges we face as the UK leaves the European Union.

The minister had the chance to talk directly to two GREAT participants – Neha, and Suzi (who now works for GREAT as an Employment Support Officer). 

Both had a chance to tell their own stories about how GREAT had helped them. Lord Callanan commented that, as someone who spends a lot of time being presented to by professionals, he was impressed by the confident presentations of Suzi and Neha.

### The future of the Building Better Opportunities programme

VAL’s Chair and Chief Executive were also involved in the meeting, and the minister was able to hear feedback from VAL and GREAT on the challenges of running Building Better Opportunities (BBO) projects as well as ideas about how a potential ‘BBO 2’ could look if Government decides to keep funding the current BBO projects after 2019.

We were extremely proud of both Neha and Suzi, who managed to articulate the benefits of GREAT in a way that we hope left a real impression on Lord Callanan. We feel he went away with some very positive messages about BBO and we look forward to seeing what happens next.
