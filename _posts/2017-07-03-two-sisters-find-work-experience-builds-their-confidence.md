title: Two sisters find work experience builds their confidence
---


We are always proud at the GREAT Project to share the stories of those who have engaged with the project and its partners.

Pictured below are two sisters, both of whom are single mothers who hadn't worked for 7 years and struggled with their confidence.

Since accessing the GREAT Project, they have taken part in confidence-building courses with PDP, followed by a two week work placement, with the support of Business in the Community, with Marks and Spencer plc.

They will be continuing their progress by engaging with LCC Work Clubs, to build on their new skills, develop interview techniques and CV writing skills and make the move towards employment or further training.

They have both reported an increase in confidence that has allowed to take on tasks that they would previously have found daunting.

Their path towards employment and training has been their path, tailored to their needs.

If the GREAT Project can help you - or someone you work with - find their own path, please contact us.
