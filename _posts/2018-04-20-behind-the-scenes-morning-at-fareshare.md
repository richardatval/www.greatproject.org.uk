On 18 April, GREAT spent a morning looking behind the scenes at Leicestershire-based charity Fareshare. 

### Who is Fareshare?

Fareshare tackles food waste across the UK by taking excess food from the food industry and individuals. They check it for quality and redistribute it to voluntary groups and businesses who can use the food for social good, such as community centres, cafes and restaurants who could provide free or low-cost meals in deprived areas.

### Behind the scenes

We invited a few GREAT participants along, and they had the chance to see how an organisation like Fareshare works. They were also able to get a feel for what Fareshare would be looking for in a volunteer (as the organisation has many volunteers to help sort and distribute the food) and in potential staff if they were to recruit.

To help us to understand what the average Fareshare volunteer has to do, we were given a pallet of donated food to sort into the correct boxes. It might look easy but it was surprisingly difficult!

We hope our participants were inspired by their morning at Fareshare and we look forward to more behind the scenes visits in the future!
