When Simon joined the GREAT Project, he had been unemployed for over a year and felt he was ready to get back into employment. He was open to looking for work in a variety of different industries, but wanted help with his confidence, CV and job search skills to help him on his way.  

> “I needed help and guidance with looking for work - I didn’t know where to start and I had no confidence moving into work. I also needed help with developing my skills to be able to find employment.”

Simon heard about the project and decided to refer himself. He quickly met with his Employment Support Officer, Leah, and together they discussed his barriers and how the GREAT Project could best support him.

Leah recommended Simon attend various workshops delivered by in-house Employment Coordinators. Simon attended their sessions on confidence building, how to best manage returning to work and interview skills. One of the things Simon credits to his development was taking part in the mock interview that features in the interview skills session. Here, individuals participate in mock interviews and receive feedback at the end, which helps them prepare for future interviews.  

Simon also attended Work Club, where he was able to work on his CV and cover letter. During Work Club sessions, participants are also shown best practices for job searching and as well as reputable employment websites, which can be extremely useful. 

One of the newer options available to participants on the GREAT Project are the sessions delivered by in-house Vocational Rehabilitation Case Officer (VRCO), Eileen. Simon attended the group session on strengths and motivations, where he was encouraged to write about his personal strengths and how he could apply them to his work. 

Whilst on the project, Simon also worked with delivery partner, Business in the Community. He attended pre-placement training where he prepared for placements and interviews, learnt the importance of first impressions, and looked at other aspects relevant to his work placement. Simon then went on to complete a work placement at a local food manufacturer, where on completion of his placement, he was offered a full time machine operative role. 

Speaking of his time on the project, Simon said:

> “I wish I did it sooner, you will be amazed at the benefits. The way the workshops are ran really open your eyes to what you’re capable of. Not only do I have more social interaction with others, I have a positive outlook on the future and feel confident within myself. I also have a job which I enjoy.”

Leah said: 

> “Working with Simon has been an absolute pleasure. I’m so glad we were able to support him and he benefited so greatly from his time with us. Simon’s a perfect example of what participants can do whilst on the project and the outcomes they can achieve.”
