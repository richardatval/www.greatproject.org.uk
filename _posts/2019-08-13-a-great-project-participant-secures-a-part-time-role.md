At the time of joining the GREAT Project, Jenny had been unemployed for two years, caring for her daughter. Her husband was also out of work and Jenny felt something had to change. She felt she lacked skills, qualifications and experience, but was determined to turn her life around.

Jenny was referred to the GREAT Project by a family support worker, and didn’t know what to expect from the project at the time of joining. She wanted to find some independence and get back into employment.

> “I wanted to get back into the world of employment and get back to what I was doing. I just wanted to find some independence and achieve something for myself.”

Jenny met with her Employment Support Officer, Imran, who created a plan specific to Jenny’s needs. Jenny started off by attending various work club sessions which allowed her to work on her CV, cover letter and job search skills. Jenny also took part in a variety of other sessions, including the FAST employment programme. This programme was designed with participants from Jenny’s locality in mind, and together, they took part in workshops around confidence building, budgeting, interview skills and returning to work. 

Through delivery partner, Business in the Community, Jenny attended different activities including a behind the scenes tour at a local logistics company. These type of activities are crucial to a participant’s journey, as it helps to make informed decisions about what type of work or industry they want to work in. She also took part in pre-placement training which prepares participants for work placements.  

Jenny completed her time with the project and successfully secured a part-time role as a kitchen assistant. 

Speaking of her time on the project, Jenny said: 

> “The GREAT Project gave me the confidence to go out and implement everything I’ve learnt. It really helped me overcome any barriers I had, and I feel really positive about meeting new people. I 100% support what the GREAT Project does, and encourage others to do it too.”

Imran said:

> “Jenny joined wanting to change her life and achieve something for herself, and she’s been able to do that with our support. I’m exceptionally proud of all she’s done and couldn’t be happier for her with her new role. I wish her all the best for the future.”
