On 24 May, the GREAT Project took part in the Fosse Jobs Fair, raising awareness of the project, talking to employers about local opportunities and giving our participants a chance to engage with employers.

Here's what some of our participants had to say about the experience:

"It was a good experience; it gave me more confidence to look for a job. I went to the interview workshop today and they made me feel less shy and more confident."

"Itâ€™s quite interesting here, there are lots of opportunities. I am just getting some basic info and when I get home I will look over and make some phone calls. Since I met Krishna (Employment Navigator), things have changed positively- that has given me the confidence to attend this event. I also felt reassured that the Work Club would be here to support me."
