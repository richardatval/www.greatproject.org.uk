Helen hadn’t applied for a job in over ten years, which is why her local Jobcentre thought it would be good for her to join the GREAT Project. At the time of joining the project, Helen was a single parent with dependent children living at home, and she felt she lacked the confidence and experience she needed to look for a job.

The Jobcentre explained to Helen all the opportunities that would be available to her as a participant on the project and she soon decided that it might be the project to help her. Helen joined knowing she needed help with her CV and cover letter, as well as her overall confidence. 

Whilst Helen was a participant on the project, she accessed various types of support that helped her towards her goals. Helen attended multiple work club sessions which allowed her to create a CV and cover letter using a computer, thus improving her IT skills as well. Helen also attended sessions delivered by in-house Employment Coordinators, allowing her to increase her knowledge of interview techniques. Through delivery partner, Business in the Community, Helen secured a work placement at a local homelessness charity, and prior to starting, she attended pre-placement training. Here, she covered a wide range of topics like first impressions and industry specific interview skills. 

Helen, speaking of her time on the project, said:

> “The GREAT Project has helped me so much. I was quite shy and worried about finding a job, particularly the interview process, but this helped me so much. It really is a great team that makes you feel valued and comfortable.” 

Diana, Helen’s Employment Support Officer, said: 

> “It’s incredible to see the transformation in Helen. Although she hadn’t worked for ten years, she was determined to make the most out of her time on the project and find a path for herself. I’m so proud of her for the effort she put in, and couldn’t be happier that she’s decided to undergo further training.” 

Helen has now completed her time with the project and has successfully gone into training, studying for a maths qualification and a course in digital skills.
