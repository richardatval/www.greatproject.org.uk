Recently, the GREAT Project headed over to Eddie Stobart to find out more about the national logistics company. 

Eddie Stobart is an industry-leading logistics business that provides end-to-end transport and logistics to organisations all across the UK and Europe. 

Alongside our partners, Business in the Community, 11 participants from the project were able to take part in a behind-the-scenes visit with Eddie Stobart at Bardon in Coalville. 

Participants were able to learn more about the site, one of the largest in Europe, its history and the roles available for those interested. They also heard from current employees about the possibility of progression within the company and the support provided for, amongst others, those with mental health needs. 

It was a wide-ranging and fascinating visit â€“ with a chance to see the warehouses in operation - and several of participants expressed an interest in applying for roles within the company.
