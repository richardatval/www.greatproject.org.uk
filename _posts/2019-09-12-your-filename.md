Ella was unemployed and living at home with her mum and younger sister at the time of joining the GREAT Project. She hadn’t worked for a while but was ready to find a paid role that would allow her to continue caring for her disabled mum.

Ella heard about the project at her local doctor’s surgery and decided to self-refer. She soon met with her Employment Support Officer (ESO), and discussed exactly what it was she was looking for support with; her confidence, job search skills, mental health and information on how working would affect her benefits. 

Ella attended the three day confidence building course. This is pivotal for those participants that struggle with their confidence and self-esteem, as it encourages participants to talk to, and engage with, one another in order to solve problems. Most participants report an increase in their confidence after attending this course. 

Ella also utilised the one-to-one support that was available from her ESO and attended a one-to-one Work Club session, where she was able to work on her CV and cover letter. 

Chantal then became Ella’s ESO. 

Speaking of her time on the project, Ella said:

> “I really enjoyed the confidence building course. Everyone was in the same boat and we worked together to help each other with our confidence. The GREAT Project really did help me, and they even helped cover costs too.”

Speaking of Ella’s time on the project, Chantal said:

> “I have only worked with Ella for a short time as she was initially working with Imran, however she has always turned up to our appointments and was willing to try new things in order to increase her confidence and achieve what she set out to do. I hope that she can continue to build on her skills and confidence in her new job as she has real potential.”

Ella completed her time with the project and found employment at a local hotel, offering her the flexibility she needed. Ella attributes her success with finding a job to the confidence building course, and hopes to continue building on her confidence and self-esteem.
