On Friday 1 March 2019, we held our annual showcase event, Changing Lives Together, to celebrate the achievements of some of our participants both past and present. 

The event was a huge success with over 100 registered delegates from various organisations across Leicester and Leicestershire. It provided all those in attendance with information about what the GREAT Project does to support the local community.

The project partners with Leicester City Council Early Help and Leicestershire County Council Supporting Leicestershire Families; both of which refer participants to the project. Both gave presentations at the event, providing an insightful look into how these partnerships work.  

Following on from this, delegates heard from the GREAT Project’s delivery partners; Leicestershire County Council Work Club, Enstruct and Business in the Community. Each partner offers something truly unique, and the work the GREAT Project does would not be possible without their support. 

The event finished with an awards ceremony to celebrate the accomplishments of some of the GREAT Project’s participants. Employment Support Officers (ESO’s) work directly with participants, and whilst every participant on the project is special, they were each asked to nominate a particular participant that excelled. Voluntary Action LeicesterShire’s Chair, Anil Majithia, presented each nominee with an award to commemorate their achievements.

Vandna Gohil, Executive Manager for the GREAT Project, said: 

> “Hearing from all the different partners the project works with really highlighted the fact that to change lives, we have to work together. By finishing the event with an awards ceremony, and simultaneously hearing the inspiring stories of our participants, we really let the audience see just how much impact the project is having in the community. Each journey is unique and inspiring.”

The GREAT Project gave a total of 14 awards during the celebration, and presented every participant in attendance with an award and certificate. In total, 10 participants had been nominated for an award by their ESO, and a further four were acknowledged for other special efforts they have made with the project. 

A list of nominees, alongside their story, can be found below:

**Shaik Faisal**

Shaik Faisal first met his Employment Support Officer (ESO) with his wife, who spoke on his behalf. He had not long suffered a stroke which drastically affected his confidence, especially when it came to speaking English. Shaik has engaged with many of the support options available to him as a participant on the project, and he says he has seen an increase in his self-esteem. His wife reports she has also seen a change in him, as does his ESO. Shaik remains on the project and will continue to access support to help him achieve his goal of finding a job.

**Khamis Maiouf**

Khamis Maiouf arrived in the UK with his family two years ago. Whilst living as a civilian in Syria, he had faced physical and psychological challenges, and could not speak English. Khamis, who had low confidence at the time of joining the project, has accessed various support whilst on the project, including work club, behind the scenes tours and advice around self-employment. Khamis now has a positive outlook and wishes to progress to university. 

**Soma Ramazan**

Soma Ramazan is a young adult living at home with her family. Soma’s family experienced a bereavement just before she was due to sit her A Level exams, and around the same time, her mother became unwell. Soma now acts as her carer, which has meant a lot of extra responsibility and additional time pressures at home. Soma accessed the confidence building course and has had one-to-one sessions with her ESO. Soma is now preparing to re-sit her A Levels and hopes for a career in medicine. 

**Tracey Bland**

Following the death of her husband, Tracey Bland was left to raise three children with special needs alone. Despite her 21 years’ experience as an SEN teaching assistant, Tracey was looking for support to help her with her confidence. She felt she had no faith in herself but put her trust in her ESO and the project. Tracey feels the project has given her more confidence, and she now feels ready to apply for roles suited to her. 

**Leena Shah**

Leena Shah, a mother of three, felt alone before she joined the project. She referred herself as she was looking to increase her job search skills and reduce her isolation. Leena has attended multiple workshops and courses, and is feeling more confident. She has a positive outlook and has shown sheer determination to better herself, and she now hopes to continue on this path and gain a qualification in maths. 

**Nickolette Robinson**

Before joining the project, Nickolette Robinson felt isolated and suffered from severe anxiety. She says she had very low self-esteem, which negatively affected her motivation levels. Whilst on the project, Nickolette accessed various support and went on to accept a work placement. She excelled and was offered employment. Nickolette is now enjoying her job, and feels she could not have done it without the help of the GREAT Project. 


**Simon Gambardella**

Simon Gambardella was dismissed from his last role due to ongoing health issues. This resulted in Simon suffering from depression and anxiety. Despite this, Simon’s attendance and commitment to the project was exceptional. He accessed a variety of courses whilst on the project, and it helped him overcome his barriers. Simon also found comfort in others who were experiencing the same challenges. Through the GREAT Project, Simon found a full time role that he enjoys and feels comfortable in. 

**Prafula Joshi**

Prafula Joshi worked in sales for 30 years prior to joining the GREAT Project. Unfortunately, she sustained a serious head injury, causing her to suffer from short-term memory loss. With three teenage children, Pru worried she would be unable to find work. Pru worked closely with her ESO and with the help of the GREAT Project, Pru attended various sessions to overcome her barriers. Pru ultimately found a part time role in care. 

**Natalie Butler**

Natalie Butler started the project with little confidence and direction. After receiving support from the GREAT Project and her ESO, Natalie began to flourish. She attended multiple workshops, and went on a behind the scenes tour at a popular high street store. The retailer was so impressed, they offered her a work placement. 

**Emma Harrison**

Emma Harrison is a single mother of two, and felt isolated in her own community. She felt she had many barriers to work, and noted her confidence as a main issue.  Whilst her original goal was to leave the project in search of a job, she actually found herself a role as a personal assistant. Emma’s confidence has grown, and she has since been elected as a local councillor for her area. 


Overall, the event was a huge success, and it truly highlighted the impact the GREAT Project has on the lives of the local community. The project is accepting both self-referrals and organisational referrals, and encourages those that have barriers to work and need support to contact them. Individuals can self-refer by texting GREAT and their name to 66777 or by calling 0116 257 5020. Organisations are free to contact the project by calling the same number.
