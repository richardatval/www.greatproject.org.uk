Before Anne joined the GREAT Project, she had been out of work for a while and had not long suffered a bereavement. Her work coach at her local Jobcentre thought the GREAT Project would be a good place for her to start. 

Anne soon met with her Employment Support Officer (ESO), Diana, and discussed what she felt her barriers were. She outlined her barriers as lack of job skills and qualifications, and simply not knowing what job opportunities were out there. Anne was referred to the FAST employment programme that in-house Employment Coordinator, Kenton, and Diana were delivering. During the FAST employment programme, participants cover topics such as confidence building, interview skills, budgeting and how to manage returning to work.

Anne also attended Work Club sessions, where she was able to create a CV and cover letter, as well as learn how to effectively look for a job. 

Whilst on the project, Anne also met with delivery parent, Business in the Community, and attended pre-placement training. During this training, she learnt how to prepare for placements and interviews, the importance of first impressions, interview skills and other aspects relevant to her placement. After the pre-placement training, Anne then went on to complete a work placement at a national supermarket. 

After completing her time with the project, Anne moved into further training, studying computer software skills through an adult resource centre in her local community. 

Speaking of her time on the project, Anne said:

> “I wasn’t sure what to expect at first but the project was very useful in helping me gain confidence in myself. It gave me more belief in myself too. Everyone was very helpful and friendly, which made me feel at ease.”
