Today, we said a temporary ‘au revoir’ to Diana, one of the GREAT Projects Employment Support Officers (ESO). Diana is going on maternity leave so she can focus on the newest addition to her family, and the GREAT Project team; her soon-to-be-born baby boy. 

Diana has been with the GREAT Project since 2017, and has been incredible colleague and friend to all of us here, not to mention an amazing ESO to her participants. At our Changing Lives Together event, Prafula Joshi, one of Diana’s participants, gave a short speech and gave Diana a special mention. 

> “My mentor, my ESO, Diana, and my friend; she’s followed me, she’s taught me and she’s still giving me support even now with the job I’ve got.”

From all of us here at GREAT and Voluntary Action LeicesterShire (VAL), we wish you all the best for motherhood and the arrival of your bundle of joy.
