Eda came to the UK a little over three years ago from her native country, Turkey. Between living in Turkey and Dubai, Eda had acquired the skills she needed for her career, but once in the UK, she was unsure how to transfer them. Eda knew she wanted to find work supporting adults, but didn’t know where to begin. 

> “I came to the UK and knew I wanted to support adults, especially refugees. I learnt the skills I needed elsewhere, but I didn’t know how to use them here and I didn’t know where to begin. I just felt lost and overwhelmed.”

Eda heard about the opportunities that would be available to her as a participant on the GREAT Project and decided to self-refer. Diana was appointed Eda’s Employment Support Officer (ESO) and met with her to understand what barriers she faced so they could work together to overcome them. Eda ultimately wanted to improve her English, learn about the opportunities available in the UK, and integrate herself more into British society. 

> “I wanted to be able to integrate and live happily in Britain. I needed to get out to meet new people and socialise, but before joining the GREAT Project, I only left the house to take my daughter to playgroup.”

Whilst on the project, Eda received support from delivery partner, Business in the Community. She visited local businesses on ‘behind the scenes’ tours, and also completed a work placement at a recognised humanitarian charity. Eda also accessed the support of Work Club, and learnt about CV’s, cover letters and job search skills.

Eda has now completed her time on the project, and is enjoying the new lease of life she has found. 

> “Now I have new friends and new skills. I have done this training and it has given me a new perspective on life! 

Diana, Eda’s Employment Support Officer, said:

> “Eda really is an inspiration. She came to the UK wanting to better herself so she could help others, and that’s such an admirable thing to do. She had the skills already, she just needed support to bring them out. I wish her all the best for the future.”

After her placement, Eda continued with the humanitarian charity and is now a permanent volunteer.
