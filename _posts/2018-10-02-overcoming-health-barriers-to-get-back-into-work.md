Rickin ran his own business and mentored in a college until serious illness changed his life significantly. He was diagnosed with Lymphoma and underwent surgery on his brain, leaving him with short term memory loss, poor problem solving, impulsivity and difficulty with concentration.

Rickin referred himself to the project to seek support with finding his way back to employment. He identified a range of barriers including his health, a lack of confidence, lack of job search skills and worrying about how going back to work would affect his benefits.

Once he joined the project, Rickin was able to access support from various GREAT partners. He received one-to-one support and had help managing his sleeping pattern, which he was struggling with. He attended work clubs, where he learned about interview techniques and how to write a CV.

Having previously been a mentor, Rickin has a passion for helping and supporting others. He is now exiting the project onto an Induction to Counselling course, and is confident about his chances of finding work in the near future.
