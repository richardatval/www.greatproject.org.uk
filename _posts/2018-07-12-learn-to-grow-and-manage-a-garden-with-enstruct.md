For two weeks this summer, Enstruct will be running a programme to help GREAT participants to improve their gardening skills and even learn a little bit about carpentry. 

Horticulture (growing and managing gardens) is a useful skill to help you to grow your own food, improve your health and manage your own garden. Horticultural activities can be fun for the whole family and are also safe and healthy.

## What the programme involves

The programme will take place over five days, the first three of which will involve activities like:

- Digging and preparing the land
- Coppicing (cutting back trees and shrubs)
- Growing simple crops from seed, cultivating and harvesting
- Growing unusual and harder to cultivate crops within polytunnels (plastic tunnels like greenhouses which allow indoor growing)
- Pruning fruit trees/shrubs
- ‘Plot to pot’ eating and cooking
- Composting
- Habitat and biodiversity awareness

The last two days will involve an introduction to carpentry, including:

- Understanding of basic terminology
- Tool use and, maintenance
- Basic cuts and joints
- Design and build a planter to take home and use to grow food

## When and where

The programme will run on the weeks beginning:

- 23 July 2018
- 20 August 2018

The first three days will be at Enstruct's two acre garden behind Fullhurst Community College, Imperial Avenue, Leicester, LE3 1AH.

The last two days will be at Enstruct's construction workshop at Faircharm Industrial Estate, Evelyn Drive, Leicester, LE3 2BU.
