title: GREAT Project at Coalville Jobs Fair
---
The GREAT Project is excited to be taking part in the Coalville Jobs Fair, being held at Stephenson College on 7 April 2017.

The event will give job seekers the chance to speak to more than 17 potential employers and get advice from expert careers advisors.

The GREAT Project will be available to discuss the wide range support we, along with our partners, can provide to those who want to move towards work and training. 

A free shuttle bus will run between the clock tower in Memorial Square in Coalville and Stephenson College on the day. There will also be free cr√®che facilities on site.
