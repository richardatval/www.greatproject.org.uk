### Why we collect personal data from you

The information you provide to the GREAT Project will be shared with the Department for Work & Pensions (DWP) and used to evaluate this project and to report to the European Social Fund for monitoring purposes, in line with European Commission regulatory requirements. 

Your information will also be shared with research organisations working on behalf of the Department for Work & Pensions who may contact you to discuss your involvement in the project for research purposes. Participation in research is voluntary and you will be asked to consent before taking part in any research activity you may be contacted about. 

The DWP may also link your personal details to official administrative records in order to monitor your employment status before your ESF support began and 6 to 12 months after you left. This information may also be shared with research organisations working on behalf of the DWP however individuals will not be identifiable and you will not be contacted about this research.

Data will not be used or shared for any commercial or marketing purposes. 

At all times your information will be kept securely, and nobody will have access to it that shouldn’t.

### Lawful basis for processing data

For the purposes of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the DWP is the data controller in respect to information processed which relates to all participation in the European Social Fund. ESF grant beneficiary organisations are data processors in respect to information processed which relates to participants in the operations and projects funded by the European Social Fund. 

DWP is not the controller for any other / additional data collected by the GREAT Project that is not essential for delivering the ESF programme, or for any personal data that would normally be collected anyway by the GREAT Project.

We use the following lawful bases for processing your data:

**Article 6(1)(e) GDPR: 
‘processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller’**
- This is the lawful basis for collecting personal data that has been chosen by the DWP.

**Article 9(2)(b) GDPR: 
‘processing is necessary for the purposes of carrying out the obligations and exercising specific rights of the controller or of the data subject in the field of employment and social security and social protection law in so far as it is authorised by Union or Member State law or a collective agreement pursuant to Member State law providing for appropriate safeguards for the fundamental rights and the interests of the data subject;’**
- This is the lawful basis chosen by the DWP for the processing of ‘special categories’ of personal data (e.g. health or ethnicity).

**Based on our legitimate interests:**
- To assess your suitability before entering the programme
- To contact you about the activities you are undertaking as part of the programme

**Based on our legal or statutory responsibilities**
- We will share your personal data with third parties where we are obliged to for legal or statutory reasons

**Based on your consent:**
- To process special categories of your personal data (e.g. data concerning your health, ethnicity, biometric data) outside of the data required by the DWP.
